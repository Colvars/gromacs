Improvements to |Gromacs| tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

In the H5MD prototype release, all |Gromacs| tools support H5MD as trajectory input/output,
where applicable.
